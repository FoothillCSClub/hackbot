# Hacks Bot

This is a discord bot for Foothill College's CS Club's Summer 2020 Hackathon 💬. It supports tracking projects, which are called "hacks".



## Commands

The following are the commands that all users can use:

### hacks list

List all the hacks.

### hacks add "a short title" @user1 [@user2]

Ex. `hacks add "A very cool project" @cooldude`

Add a hack! Make sure to specify a description (quote with " if more than one word) and at least one user with an `@mention`.


### hacks update X "description" [@user1]

Ex. `hacks update 4 "A very cool project"`

Ex. `hacks update 12 "Not sure what this is.." @dude @coder`

Update a hack. A new description is required, and an updated list of members is optional.


### hacks remove X

Ex. `hacks remove 6`

Remove a hack. Tip: use `hacks list` to list all the hacks with their index.


### hacks link X URL

Ex. `hacks link 6 https://github.com/FoothillCSClub/hackbot`

Add a project link to a hack. A URL is required.


### hacks unlink X

## Admin

### hacks delete #channel
