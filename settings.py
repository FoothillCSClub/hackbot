__**ABOUT THE HACKATHON**__

This summer, Foothill CS Club is hosting an online hackathon! You can start whenever you like, choose a project based on your interests, and work in groups or alone.

At the end of the hackathon, we will show off our creations, and everybody who participates can vote on their favorite project.

We don't have any required theme, but if you aren't sure what you want to make, then you can look at some of the ideas posted here, or check out what others are working on.  Feel free to chat with others in <#403068808748597249> to discuss ideas.

This hackathon is meant to be collaborative rather than competitive. Learn something new, make an experiment, and have fun!


__**OTHER NOTES**__

- It's okay to have your project be an improvement to an old project that you've already started.


__**POSSIBLE PROJECT IDEAS**__

- Make a website
- Make a discord bot
- Make a video game
